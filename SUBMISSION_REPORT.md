# Something Awesome Project 

## How to Mark
The project provides write-ups of picoCTF. The purpose of this is to provide a learning tool for
beginners to learn about the foundations of capture-the-flag challenges. PicoCTF is a Jeopardy-style
CTF consisting of challenges related to [general skills](#general-skills), [cryptography](#cryptography), [web exploitation](#web-exploitation), [forensics](#forensics), [reverse engineering](#reverse-engineering) and [binary exploitation](#binary-exploitation). In the given Github [link](#https://github.com/kaliypsocraft/something-awesome) contains a `REPORT.md` file which contains the following:

There includes five main-subsections corresponding to each challenge-type. Within each challenge there are two components. A theortical component which is compilation of my background research on the topics and a practical component which is the write-ups. The write-ups are represented by a hyper-link to a particular challenge with approximately 10-15 write-ups per challenge-type. 

Within each write-up it is divided up as per the template provided on the Github repo. There is a initial prepartory stage which involves the initial research, static and dynamic analysis of the program. There is then an attack phase which dictates the payload and method of exploitation utilised in order to obtain the flag. There is then a lessons-learnt tab which dictates the challenges which were required in order to overcome the problem. 
Good examples where I gained the most in each exercise include .... TODO: INSERT TO MAKE EASIER

As per the Table of Contents below this section there is a diary entry which is a weekly reflection on the progress of the project. It is divided up into **'what I did?'**, **'What challenges I faced'** and **'How to fix these errors'**.

## Features


## Challenges Experienced 
The general consensus with most of the challenges was knowing where to start and what tools to use. Since I was a beginner to CTFs intepreting a problem was difficult as I had no frame of reference. The following sub-sections dictates the specific challenges experienced within each challenge-type.
### Binary Exploitation
### Web Exploitation
### Cryptography
### Forensics
### Reverse Engineering

## Fixes
Over time the general fix that rectified much of the challenges was time on tools - namely conducting deliberate practice. The following sub-sections dictates specific fixes to the challenges experienced above.
### Binary Exploitation
### Web Exploitation
### Cryptography
### Forensics
### Reverse Engineering


## Diary
  The diary serves as a logbook for weekly evaluations in order to enhance productivity and to maintain purpose. 
  Each week consists of a more detailed overview of what is conducted in order to advance the state of the project. 
  The intention behind the diary is to be mindful and to maximise intent with all activities on a day to day basis.
## Week 1
### What I did?
- Week 1 was just getting the cogs moving and selecting between projects. At this stage, I was debating between a cryptography research project or a CTF write-up.

### What I need to improve?
- Reduce screen time
- Be swift and decisive with choosing a project

### How to fix errors?
- Be mindful and deliberate with the selection of tasks and projects.

## Week 2
### What I did?
- Solving SQL Injections and Buffer Overflows (being hands-on)
- These tasks further assisted me on my CTF write-ups/tutorial project.
- They exposed me to more CTF-related challenges and gave me some insight into the thinking patterns required for CTFs and the psychology behind them.

### What I need to improve?
- Develop a deeper understanding of SQL injection techniques and their real-world applications.
- Practice more buffer overflow exercises to improve my confidence in exploiting this vulnerability.

### How to fix errors?
- Use online platforms like Hack The Box and TryHackMe to practice SQL injections and buffer overflow challenges.
- Set weekly goals for specific vulnerabilities to focus on, ensuring steady progress.

## Week 3
### What I did?
- Conducted Wargames specifically on XSS Injection-related tasks.
- Continued my Something Awesome Project - made a website via Canva.
- Wrote Something Awesome Project Write-Ups on a markdown file ready to transfer over.
- Finished 12 CTF challenges related to SAP.
- Attended B-Sides!
- There was a talk on exploitation of AI models and modern cryptographic attacks which intrigued me.
- Engaged in discussions with industry professionals during the B-Sides event, gaining insights into emerging trends in cybersecurity.
- Developed a better understanding of different types of XSS attacks and their mitigations.

### What I need to improve?
- Strengthen my knowledge of different types of web vulnerabilities beyond XSS.
- Enhance my ability to articulate findings and strategies in my write-ups for better clarity.

### How to fix errors?
- Dedicate time to researching and practicing additional web vulnerabilities, such as CSRF and RCE.
- Seek feedback on my write-ups from peers or mentors to improve my communication skills and technical accuracy.

## Week 4
### What I did?
- Completed advanced web exploitation challenges, particularly focusing on session management vulnerabilities.
- Began learning about heap exploitation techniques, which will add depth to my Something Awesome Project.
- Drafted additional CTF write-ups for the ongoing project, covering techniques like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection.

### What I need to improve?
- Refine my understanding of heap exploitation, as some concepts are still unclear.
- Improve time management between different tasks (CTF challenges, research, and project write-ups).

### How to fix errors?
- Set aside focused study sessions specifically for heap exploitation concepts, using resources like wargames or tutorials.
- Create a more structured daily schedule to balance CTF challenges, project progress, and personal research.

## Week 5
  ### What I did?
- This week conducted format strings practice on picoCTF as that is what we learnt in the Thursday Extended lecture
- Conducted post-quantum cryptography research specifically post-quantum digital signatures
- Read into a data structure 
  ### What I need to improve?
- Once again phone has stolen my attention at times.
- Rushing into a problem rather than taking the time to slow down and think.
- Hitting dead ends in problems and feeling demoralised.
  ### How to fix errors?
- Set aside time to be cognizant of *how to* solve a problem rather than diving straight in.
- Be mindful and intentional in everything I do and be methodical in my thinking
## Week 6
 ### What I did?

  ### What I need to improve?
- 
  ### How to fix errors?
- Given a deadline of approximately 14 days. I need to conduct approximately 8-10 exercises a day. Since there is five challenge types, it would be wise
to conduct one-two exercises per challenge-type a day.
- The end-state of this is that I will be finished within a week. This will enable me another week to edit and flesh out the responses. I will give myself 30 minutes per challenge. Therefore at the very least it will be 3 - 5 hours of work per day.
- Break this up into 2-3 deep work blocks.
