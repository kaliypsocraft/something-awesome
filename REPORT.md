# Something Awesome Project 

The project provides write-ups of picoCTF. The purpose of this is to provide a learning tool for
beginners to learn about the foundations of capture-the-flag challenges. PicoCTF is a Jeopardy-style
CTF consisting of challenges related to [general skills](#general-skills), [cryptography](#cryptography), [web exploitation](#web-exploitation), [forensics](#forensics), [reverse engineering](#reverse-engineering) and [binary exploitation](#binary-exploitation).

## Diary
  The diary serves as a logbook for weekly evaluations in order to enhance productivity and to maintain purpose. 
  Each week consists of a more detailed overview of what is conducted in order to advance the state of the project. 
  The intention behind the diary is to be mindful and to maximise intent with all activities on a day to day basis.
## Week 1
  ### What I did?
  - Week 1 was just getting the cogs moving and selecting between projects. At this stage I was debating between a cryptography 
  research project or a CTF write-up. 
  ### What I need to improve?
  - Reduce screen-time
  - Be swift and decisive with choosing project
  ### How to fix errors?
  - Be mindful and deliberate with the selection of tasks and projects.
## Week 2
   ### What I did?
  - Solving SQL Injections and Buffer Overflows (being hands on)
  - These tasks further assists me on my CTF write-ups/tutorial project.
  - They exposed me to more CTF related challenges and gave me some insight into the thinking patterns required for CTF's and the psychology behind them.
  ### What I need to improve?

  ### How to fix errors?
## Week 3
   ### What I did?
  - Conducted Wargames specifically XSS Injection related tasks
  - Continued my Something Awesome Project - made a website via Canva.
  - Wrote Something Awesome Project Write-Ups on a markdown file ready to transfer over
  - Finished 12 CTF challenges related to SAP
  - B-Sides!

## Challenges
List the key features of your project.
## General Skills
General skills consist of using the basic tools and tricks of the trade such as Linux commands e.t.c. The skills learnt from these
challenges form the prequesite knowledge required for not just CTFs but computing literacy for a computer-science student. 
## Cryptography
Cryptography is the process of obsfucating information from unauthorised people. Usually modern cryptographic algorithms must
satisfy three properties: 
1. Confidentiality
2. Integrity
3. Authentication
Within CTF challenges they usually begin with basic classical ciphers such as the Caesar cipher. Moderate challenges may include
a substitution cipher or Vigenere ciphers which may require a more sophisticated cryptanalytic attack. 
## Web Exploitation

## Getting Started

Provide instructions on how to get a copy of the project and run it on the local machine.

### Prerequisites

List any software or libraries that need to be installed before running the project.

### Building

Explain how to build the project. Include any specific commands or build systems used.

```bash
# Example build command
make
