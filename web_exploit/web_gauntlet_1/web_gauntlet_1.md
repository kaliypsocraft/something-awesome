## Write-Up

### Preparatory Phase
Revising basic payloads and 

### Attack Phase
Given five sub-challenges where by each challenge has new filters placed on the user input. For example,

At about Round 4 was when I had some problems, namely with 
![alt text](images/image-1.png)

The reason it was abit more difficult was because it filtered out the word 'admin'.

The previous three rounds I used the same payload since it did not filter for the `#` comment tag. I first attempted to conduct a `UNION`-based attack by trying to find potentially the password for admin in some table - however the program seemed to filter out white-space. Upon further research online I found out we can concatenate strings in SQL via ![alt text](images/image-4.png)

Now my final payload was `adm'||'in';#` which could work for all five Gauntlet challenges.

### Lessons Learnt
Using SQL documentation and finding the right one can take some time. For example I initially found many other 'sql injection cheatsheets' but they did not include the concatenation. Therefore perserverance in scowering the net was vital in the success of this challenge.
