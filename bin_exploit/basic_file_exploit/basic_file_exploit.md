## Write-Up

### Step 1: [Prepartory]

- Within the `data_read` function I found in order to output the flag, we need `entry_number = strtol(entry, NULL, 10)` to be evaluated as `0`.
- Upon reading the `man` page for the `strtol` function it evaulates to zero, if the there were no digits present in the string. In this case, the variable `entry` must not contain any integers for this. 

### Step 2: [Attack]
- Run `nc <host> <port>`

- Pressing `1` I write to the database a string consisting of [a-zA-Z] only (I need this step otherwise it does not allow me to press `2`)
- Pressing `2` it asks for my `entry number` whereby I input a string consisting of [a-zA-Z].

### Step 3: [Reorganisation]
- During Step 2, it is not necessary to write to the database using only [a-zA-Z]. I tried a second time using [0-9] and it worked. However, when asked for the entry number it is essential we use only [a-zA-Z].
