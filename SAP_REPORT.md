The CTF medium provides immediate feedback on the progress of tasks. The concepts and techniques required were often just out-of-reach and required reading documentation and online material in order to attack problems. 

## How to Mark

This document is solely to document the summary of obstacles experienced. includes **five main-subsections** corresponding to **each CTF challenge-type**. Within each challenge-type 

!!! note `cat SAP_REPORT.[pdf|md]`
    At each section it includes a tree of obstacles/challenges. Along the way in learning how to solve these CTF problem. For example conducting buffer-overflow attacks requires knowledge on how the stack operates and the role of certain registers such as `eip` or `rip`. Note these trees are non-exhaustive and they simply are what I experienced thus far in the 6-7 weeks of conducting `picoCTF`. 

```
â””â”€â”€ <Problem Type>

#### Other Files
The `REPORT.md` provides write-ups of picoCTF. PicoCTF is a Jeopardy-style CTF consisting of challenges related to [cryptography](#cryptography), [web exploitation](#web-exploitation), [forensics](#forensics), [reverse engineering](#reverse-engineering) and [binary exploitation](#binary-exploitation). In the given Github [link](https://github.com/kaliypsocraft/something-awesome) contains a `REPORT.md` file which contains the following:

!!! note `cat REPORT.md`
     It includes **five main-subsections** corresponding to **each CTF challenge-type**. Within each challenge-type there are two components. A **theoretical component** which is a compilation of my background research on the topics and a **practical component** which are represented by the write-ups. The write-ups contains much of the analysis, findings and personal reflections along the way. The write-ups are represented by a hyper-link to a particular challenge with approximately 5-10 write-ups per challenge-type. Below are some examples:

> Example of practical component

!!! note What is in a write-up
    
    Within each **write-up** it is divided up as per the template provided on the Github repo.  
    1. There is a initial **preparatory stage** which involves the initial **research**, static and dynamic analysis of the program. 

    2. There is then an **attack phase** which dictates the payload and method of exploitation utilised in order to obtain the flag. 

    3. There is then a **lessons-learnt** tab which dictates the **challenges** which were required in order to overcome the problem.

## Challenges Experienced 
!!! note
    The following sections outlines the specific obstacles experienced along the way during the conduct of the CTF and the writing of the report. There are two main components - first consists of the hurdles experienced and second the fixes utilised to rectify the issues.

##  General Obstacles
The general consensus with most of the challenges was knowing **where to start** and **what tools to use** - by extension **how to use the tools**. Since I was a beginner to CTFs intepreting a problem was difficult as I had no frame of reference for some challenges.

Most challenges whereby I had limited-no experience required atleast an hour of background reading and researching in order to tackle them. The following sub-sections dictates the specific challenges experienced within each challenge-type.

Often-times in medium-hard problems  I would be led down a rabbit-hole thinking it would solve the problem. However, it often would lead to deadends and further discourage the candidate. For example, spending an hour researching a topic and attempting to apply it to no avail. This obstacles span beyond CTFs and into real-world professional development. 

These experiences were essential in the development of skills

### Binary Exploitation

```
â””â”€â”€ Binary Exploitation
    â”œâ”€â”€ Buffer Overflow â”€â”€â”€â”€ Heap Overflow
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ret2win                 â””â”€â”€ use-after-free 
    |   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ gdb
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ rop chains 
    â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ return oriented programming 
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ret2libc                â””â”€â”€ gadgets
    â”‚           â””â”€â”€ registers
    â”œâ”€â”€ Format String Vulnerabilities
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ arbitary read
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ arbitary write
    â”‚                   â””â”€â”€ format specifiers
    â”‚                              â””â”€â”€ specific sizes   
    â”œâ”€â”€ Gdb
    â”œâ”€â”€ Ghidra
    â””â”€â”€ BinaryNinja
     
```
The main sub-challenge types I encountered in the binary-exploitation class were **buffer overflows** and **format string exploitations**. There was also one challenge which involved a **heap overflow**, exploiting a **use-after-free exploit**.

#### Buffer Overflows
The primary challenges with buffer overflows emerged when basic protections like NX and canaries were introduced, requiring a higher level of skill to bypass. Exploiting these vulnerabilities also demanded a solid understanding of gdb and stack mechanics. Initially, using gdb was challenging, but it became essential for navigating these attacks.

Another key skill was grasping calling conventions, especially for ret2libc challenges. Sometimes I would spend hours troubleshooting, only to discover that differences between 32-bit and 64-bit calling conventions were causing issues.

In general, binary exploitation exercises required me to master canonical attacks, including buffer overflows, format string exploitations, and return-oriented programming. Within buffer-overflow attacks, overcoming protections like NX and canaries presented unique difficulties.

For example, ret2libc challenges often involved complex concepts. Occasionally, I struggled to understand why certain stepsâ€”like selecting specific gadgetsâ€”were necessary in online tutorials. Tackling these new concepts often created a web of dependencies, which required focused study and practice to unravel.

#### Format String Vulnerabilities

Learning format string exploits extended upon the knowledge from buffer overflows. The main challenges associated with format string vulnerabilities was understanding the impact of certain format specifiers. For example using `%p | %p` or `%x | %x` to find the offset was relatively straightforward. However, then using this information to conduct arbitary writes took some time to wrap my head around. 
### Binary Exploitation Fixes :wrench:
Improvements in binary exploitation

To improve in binary exploitation, I practiced with tools like `GDB` (GNU Debugger) and `pwntools`, which helped me better understand register manipulation and memory management. Visual aids, such as online stack visualization tools, also allowed me to grasp the flow of stack frames and memory layouts. 

Studying `32-bit` and `64-bit` calling conventions separately enabled me to identify architectural differences and increased my comfort with function prologues and epilogues.

Reading the documentation provided by `printf(3) man` ([link](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/printf.3.html)) solidified

### Web Exploitation
```
â””â”€â”€ Web Exploitation
    â”œâ”€â”€ Web Frameworks
    â”‚    â””â”€â”€ Injection-based attacks
    â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ SQL â”€â”€ different version syntax
    |       â”œâ”€â”€ XSS
    â”‚       â””â”€â”€ CSRF
    â”‚
    â”œâ”€â”€ Web Tokens
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€JWT
    â”‚   
    â””â”€â”€ PHP
```

#### Web Frameworks
Web exploitation presented several challenges, primarily due to my limited knowledge of web development and network fundamentals. However, it has become one of the most valuable skills to have in my toolkit.

Familiarity with web development frameworks and applications is essential for web exploitation, as is a strong grasp of the skills commonly used in penetration testing. My limited understanding of HTTP request headers, including `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`, initially hindered my progress.

#### Web Tokens
This area of knowledge closely tied into my broader web exploitation efforts.

#### Injection-based Attacks
SQL injection challenges, in particular, required a deep understanding of syntax. For example, certain tasks included keyword filters, prompting research into alternative SQL commands or obfuscation techniques to bypass these restrictions.
### Web Exploitation Fixes :wrench:
Addressing challenges in web exploitation required learning web fundamentals, so I worked through beginner courses in SQL, HTML, and network protocols.

 For SQL injection tasks, I experimented with different types from SQLite to MySQL to understand their syntax differences. 

Using applications like `Burp Suite` improved my understanding of request/response patterns and helped in identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities.

### Cryptography
```
â””â”€â”€ Cryptography
    â”œâ”€â”€ Classical Ciphers
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Caesar Cipher/ROT-13
    |   â”œâ”€â”€ Vigenere Cipher
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Substitution Cipher
    â”‚
    â”œâ”€â”€ Modern Cryptography
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ RSA â”€â”€ Wieners Attack 
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Side channel attacks 
    â””â”€â”€ XOR Ciphers
```


My experience in cryptography provided a helpful foundation for tackling challenges, yet integrating pwntools for payload crafting and optimization still posed a learning curve. Developing efficient scripts required both experimentation and refinement to make them as streamlined as possible.

#### Manual Decryption
I also challenged myself to manually develop decryptors for classical ciphers like VigenÃ¨re and substitution ciphers, avoiding automated tools. This exercise helped deepen my understanding of encryption techniques and cipher mechanics.

#### Side-Channel Attacks
The Power Analysis exercise introduced me to the hands-on application of side-channel attacks, where I learned to analyze cryptographic operations by measuring power consumption. This approach required a mix of precision and knowledge about how power variations can reveal sensitive data, which significantly broadened my understanding of cryptography.
### Cryptography Fixes :wrench:
Improving my skills in cryptography meant getting more hands-on experience with `pwntools` for payload generation. 

Building custom decryptors using taught me practical cryptanalysis skills, which I complemented by researching side-channel attacks to better understand physical vulnerabilities in cryptographic systems.

### Forensics 
```
â””â”€â”€ Forensics
    â”œâ”€â”€ File Formats
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Hex Dumps
    |   â”œâ”€â”€ Metadata
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Endianness
    â”‚
    â”œâ”€â”€ Network Analysis
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Wireshark
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Packet Capture Analysis
    â”œâ”€â”€ Disk Imaging
    â””â”€â”€ Steganography
```
#### File Formats
Forensics required research into file formats, forensic tools, and interpreting hex dumps. This involved a comprehensive understanding of file signatures, types, and low-level data structures. I worked with Linux command-line tools such as `strings` and `xxd` to extract hidden data and identify file characteristics, which helped build an understanding of file system layouts and common forensic analysis techniques.
#### Network Analysis
The main challenge associated with network analysis was getting a basic undestanding of the fundamentals of networks. By extension, grasping the fundamentals of Wireshark. 

#### Disk Imaging


#### Steganography

This was a new skill to learn about. 


### Forensics Fixes :wrench:
To build my forensics skills, I spent time learning Linux commands more thoroughly, focusing on tools like `xxd`, `strings`, and `hexdump` to analyze file structures and metadata. Studying specific file formats and signatures enabled me to better identify unusual patterns in hex dumps. I also practiced using forensics tools such as `Autopsy` for memory analysis, helping me develop a systematic approach to analyzing file data and hidden information.

### Reverse Engineering
```
â””â”€â”€ Reverse Engineering
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ Debuggers
Assembly Language      â”œâ”€â”€ gdb
    â”‚                  â””â”€â”€ windbg
    â”‚
    â”œâ”€â”€ Disassemblers
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ BinaryNinja
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Ghidra
    â””â”€â”€ C programming language
```
#### Disassemblers
Once getting a grip of the basics of gdb and BinaryNinja, much of the obstacles involved staying mentally switched on with the flow of the programs. 
#### Debuggers
Learning how to use `gdb` was a fundamental skill to obtain.

#### Assembly Language
Reverse engineering required similar foundational skills as binary exploitation, with an added emphasis on using disassemblers and debuggers. Since I had limited experience with assembly language and machine code, learning to interpret disassembly output required understanding each instruction's purpose, as well as recognizing common patterns such as loops, conditional branches, and function calls.

#### C Programming Language
Getting a deeper grasp of the `C` language was a necessary skill to build. 


I spent considerable time experimenting with different debugging techniques, using breakpoints and stepping through code to monitor how variables and memory addresses changed. 
### Reverse Engineering Fixes :wrench:
For reverse engineering, I used disassemblers like `Ghidra` and debuggers such as `Gdb` to develop a structured approach to understanding disassembly. Working withassembly code snippets allowed me to understand common instruction sets and patterns. This further assisted in the obstacles in the binary exploitation problem sets.

Regular practice with `gdb` step-through debugging helped me better interpret function calls and memory allocations in unfamiliar binary files, ultimately boosting my confidence with low-level code.

---

### Other General Challenges
Other issues were more logistical but still affected my workflow. Commonly encountered PATH issues and package errors required time and patience to resolve. Often, I relied on Stack Overflow or community forums for troubleshooting, though in some cases, the solutions required manual adjustments to environment settings or reconfiguration of dependencies to ensure all tools functioned smoothly.

Other challenges included the ability to convey a new concept in text. This tested both my ability to assimulate the knowledge aswell as communicate it. 

####  Meta-challenges
Learning basic markdown formatting was a nice skill to have in my back pocket. It provides nice features such as in-built. Converting the `.md` $\rightarrow$ `.html` $\rightarrow$ `.pdf` proved to be a non-trivial task.

## Overall Growth
!!! note Reflecting
    This section summarises the overall personal growth provided by this project. It culminates all the challenges experienced with the weekly diary to provide the final output.

    Upon further reflection more time taken to convert the `.html` file into a deployed website could have made the experience easier for the viewer. i FOUND 
    
    To sum up, this project was relatively challenging mainly due to the wide-range of skills I was required to learn. Balancing the development of new skills with other tasks in the academic term was an intellectually stimulating and fulfilling experience. 

    I thank the staff and other students for making this course so fun :)
