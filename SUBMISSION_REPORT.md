## Features


## Challenges Experienced 
The general consensus with most of the challenges was knowing where to start and what tools to use. Since I was a beginner to CTFs intepreting a problem was difficult as I had no frame of reference for some challenges. For example, most challenges whereby I had limited-no experience required atleast an hour of background reading and researching in order to tackle them. The following sub-sections dictates the specific challenges experienced within each challenge-type.

### Binary Exploitation

```
â””â”€â”€ Binary Exploitation
    â”œâ”€â”€ Buffer Overflow
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ret2win
    |   â”œâ”€â”€ rop chains
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ret2libc
    â”‚
    â”œâ”€â”€ Format String Vulnerabilities
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ arbitary read
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ arbitary write
    â”‚
    â”œâ”€â”€ Gdb
    â”œâ”€â”€ Ghidra
    â”œâ”€â”€ BinaryNinja
    â””â”€â”€ 
```

Binary exploitation required a deeper understanding of low-level programming, which included intensive research into registers, hardware, instruction sets, memory management, and stack mechanics. I had limited knowledge of these areas prior, so it was a steep learning curve.

The main challenges with binary exploitation exercises was getting accustomed to canonical attacks such as buffer overflows, format string exploitations and return-oriented programming.  

Within the buffer-overflow type attacks learning ways to overcome basic file protections such as `NX-enabled` or `canary-enabled` was difficult. 

Learning new concepts such as these new concepts creates a tree of dependencies 





TODO: Include screenshots of each challenge 


### Binary Exploitation Fixes :wrench:
To improve in binary exploitation, I practiced with tools like `GDB` (GNU Debugger) and `pwntools`, which helped me better understand register manipulation and memory management. Visual aids, such as online stack visualization tools, also allowed me to grasp the flow of stack frames and memory layouts. 

Studying `32-bit` and `64-bit` calling conventions separately enabled me to identify architectural differences and increased my comfort with function prologues and epilogues.

### Web Exploitation
```
â””â”€â”€ Web Exploitation
    â”œâ”€â”€ Injections
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ SQL
    |   â”œâ”€â”€ XSS
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ CSRF
    â”‚
    â”œâ”€â”€ Web Tokens
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€JWT
    â”‚   
    â””â”€â”€ PHP
```
Web exploitation posed several challenges due to my limited knowledge of web development and network principles. Tackling these challenges involved studying various components, including SQL, HTML, web tokens, and HTTP request types. SQL injection challenges, in particular, required an in-depth understanding of syntax. For example, some tasks filtered certain keywords, necessitating research into alternative SQL commands or obfuscation techniques to bypass these filters. 

- Different SQL dialects (such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite) presented syntax variations that affected query construction. 
- Understanding the interactions between front-end and back-end processes helped me bridge my knowledge gaps in network requests and HTTP headers. Each of these steps was essential to gain the competency required to identify potential web vulnerabilities.
### Web Exploitation Fixes :wrench:
Addressing challenges in web exploitation required learning web fundamentals, so I worked through beginner courses in SQL, HTML, and network protocols. For SQL injection tasks, I experimented with different dialects to understand their syntax differences, which helped me tackle injection challenges more efficiently. Additionally, using web proxies like `Burp Suite` improved my understanding of request/response patterns and helped in identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities.

### Cryptography
```
â””â”€â”€ Cryptography
    â”œâ”€â”€ Classical Ciphers
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Caesar Cipher/ROT-13
    |   â”œâ”€â”€ Vigenere Cipher
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Substitution Cipher
    â”‚
    â”œâ”€â”€ Modern Cryptography
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ RSA â”€â”€ Wieners Attack 
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Side channel attacks 
    â””â”€â”€ XOR Ciphers
```


Having some experience in cryptography allowed me to approach challenges with a bit more familiarity. However, learning to integrate `pwntools` to craft and optimize payloads was still a challenge, as was fine-tuning scripts for efficiency. I also imposed a self-challenge to develop my own decryptors for classical ciphers, such as VigenÃ¨re and substitution ciphers, rather than relying on automated tools. This helped me gain a more profound understanding of manual cryptanalysis techniques like frequency analysis, letter pattern recognition, and ciphertext structure.


Encountering new cryptographic techniques like side-channel attacks was enlightening. For instance, working on a `Power Analysis` exercise introduced me to physical attack vectors that exploit unintentional information leakage, which was a fascinating area of research within cryptography that required me to learn about hardware vulnerabilities.
### Cryptography Fixes :wrench:
Improving my skills in cryptography meant getting more hands-on experience with `pwntools` for payload generation. I also studied cryptographic attacks and algorithms in-depth, which helped me optimize payloads and understand advanced cryptographic techniques. Building custom decryptors taught me practical cryptanalysis skills, which I complemented by researching side-channel attacks to better understand physical vulnerabilities in cryptographic systems.

### Forensics 
```
â””â”€â”€ Forensics
    â”œâ”€â”€ File Formats
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Hex Dumps
    |   â”œâ”€â”€ Vigenere Cipher
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Substitution Cipher
    â”‚
    â”œâ”€â”€ Network Analysis
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ RSAâ”€â”€ Wieners Attack â”€â”€ Side Channel Attacks
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 
    â””â”€â”€
```
Forensics required research into file formats, forensic tools, and interpreting hex dumps. This involved a comprehensive understanding of file signatures, types, and low-level data structures. I worked with Linux command-line tools such as `strings` and `xxd` to extract hidden data and identify file characteristics, which helped build an understanding of file system layouts and common forensic analysis techniques.

Decoding file types and distinguishing legitimate data from corrupted or malicious code required a keen eye for patterns within hex dumps and metadata. This skill was critical when exploring altered files or partial data, where even slight changes in byte sequences could significantly impact analysis. I also had to learn about specific forensic tools and workflows, including data carving and extracting deleted or partially overwritten files.
### Forensics Fixes :wrench:
To build my forensics skills, I spent time learning Linux commands more thoroughly, focusing on tools like `xxd`, `strings`, and `hexdump` to analyze file structures and metadata. Studying specific file formats and signatures enabled me to better identify unusual patterns in hex dumps. I also practiced using forensics tools such as `Autopsy` for memory analysis, helping me develop a systematic approach to analyzing file data and hidden information.

### Reverse Engineering
```
â””â”€â”€ Reverse Engineering
    â”œâ”€â”€ Debuggers
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ gdb
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ windbg
    â”‚
    â”œâ”€â”€ Disassemblers
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ BinaryNinja
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Ghidra
    â””â”€â”€
```
Reverse engineering required similar foundational skills as binary exploitation, with an added emphasis on using disassemblers and debuggers. Since I had limited experience with assembly language and machine code, learning to interpret disassembly output required understanding each instruction's purpose, as well as recognizing common patterns such as loops, conditional branches, and function calls.

I spent considerable time experimenting with different debugging techniques, using breakpoints and stepping through code to monitor how variables and memory addresses changed. As I developed more comfort with reverse engineering, I learned to recognize function patterns and optimize my approach to analyzing unfamiliar binary files.
### Reverse Engineering Fixes :wrench:
For reverse engineering, I used disassemblers like `Ghidra` and debuggers such as `Gdb` to develop a structured approach to understanding disassembly. Working with small, isolated assembly code snippets allowed me to grasp common instruction sets and patterns. Regular practice with breakpoints and step-through debugging helped me better interpret function calls and memory allocations in unfamiliar binary files, ultimately boosting my confidence with low-level code.

### General 'Petty' Challenges
Other issues were more logistical but still affected my workflow. Commonly encountered PATH issues and package errors required time and patience to resolve. Often, I relied on Stack Overflow or community forums for troubleshooting, though in some cases, the solutions required manual adjustments to environment settings or reconfiguration of dependencies to ensure all tools functioned smoothly.

### Meta-challenges
Learning basic markdown formatting was a nice skill to have in my back pocket. It provides nice features such as in-built
