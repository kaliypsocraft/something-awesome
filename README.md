## What this project is?
There is a `REPORT.md` file which is a digest/summary of all that was conducted throughout
the project's lifespan. It consists of weekly updates, basic background information on CTF challenges among other things.
In the repository there consists five directories which contain challenges in relation to the directory. For example
crypto/ will contain all CTF challenges related to cryptography. 

## Where are the write-ups?
Within the `REPORT.md` file there are hyperlinks which automatically send the reader to a particular challenge. Each 
write-up contains challenge-type, difficulty-level, the flag, thought-process and tools utilised. They are located within
each challenge directory.
